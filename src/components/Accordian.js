        "  No, each Loothereum Chest design has its own chance of winning. To maintain the mystery of the loot, we will not be publicly displaying the probability breakdown, as we feel this provides a fairness to all those who purchase our loot chests. Each design will have varying supply. ",

        "Rewards will be unlocked as we reach milestones of % sold. Once 80% is sold, every reward tier will be available. During the rewards drawing we will be randomly selecting the winning Mint #'s and dispersing the rewards to the owners wallet. ",
